Development of a basic financial system using Python.
The user could create recipes, expenses and investments. The program runs with a while loop and menu lists.
At the first run, the program try to find a file in the root path, if it not exists, a file will be created and saved in the end of the application.

The user can navigate between the menu lists and interact with the system.


The system can handle errors and treat them, showing informative messages to the user.

The project focus was about to explore a public dataset and get some insights and understanding the dataset.
The chosen dataset was the central bank's mortgage credit database. The ideia of the project was to handle with the dataset, spliting the info column into different other columns.
The pandas library was extremely important for carrying out all the data processing and separation.
After data transformation, we start exploring the filtered data, checking the credit amount for each state, the growth of credit over time and what kind of credit is more common.

The matplotlib was used to plot some graphs to see graphically the changes over time and differences of the credit amount, between states.
